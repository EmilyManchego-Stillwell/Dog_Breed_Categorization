dog of terrier-like demeanor, weighing no more than 6 pounds. The rounded \u201capple\u201d head is a breed hallmark. The erect ears and full, luminous eyes are acutely expressive. Coats come in many colors and patterns, and can be long or short. The varieties are identical except for coat.Chihuahuas possess loyalty, charm, and big-dog attitude. Even tiny dogs require training, and without it this clever scamp will rule your household like a little Napoleon. Compact and confident, Chihuahuas are ideal city pets. They are too small for roughhousing with kids, and special care must be taken in cold weather, but Chihuahuas are adaptable\u2014as long as they get lots of quality time in their preferred lap. The Chihuahua is a tiny dog with a huge personality. A national symbol of Mexico, these alert and amusing \"purse dogs\" stand among the oldest breeds of the Americas, with a lineage going back to the ancient kingdoms of pre-Columbian times.","Maltese_dog":"Maltese are affectionate toy dogs weighing less than seven pounds, covered by a long, straight, silky coat. Beneath the all-white mantle is a compact body moving with a smooth and effortless gait. The overall picture depicts free-flowing elegance and balance. The irresistible Maltese face\u2014with its big, dark eyes and black gumdrop nose\u2014can conquer the most jaded sensibility.Despite their aristocratic bearing, Maltese are hardy and adaptable pets. They make alert watchdogs who are fearless in a charming toy-dog way, and they are game little athletes on the agility course. Maltese are low-shedding, long-lived, and happy to make new friends of all ages. Sometimes stubborn and willful, they respond well to rewards-based training. The tiny Maltese, \u201cYe Ancient Dogge of Malta,\u201d has been sitting in the lap of luxury since the Bible was a work in progress. Famous for their show-stopping, floor-length coat, Maltese are playful, charming, and adaptable toy companions.","Pekinese":"Pekingese are compact, stocky toy dogs weighing up to 14 pounds. The coat is longest at the neck and shoulders, giving Pekes their famous \u201clion\u2019s mane.\u201d Coats come in various reds, from a golden-red to darker shades. The large, short-muzzled head is a wider-than-long \u201cenvelope shaped\u201d rectangle, and the eyes are large, dark, and sparkly. A unique feature of Pekes is their effortless \u201crolling\u201d gait.Pekes are charming, confident companions who develop a tight bond with their favorite human. Bred to live in palaces, they can be as serenely independent as the emperors who owned them. (They\u2019re \u201copinionated,\u201d Peke people say.) Ever alert, they make good watchdogs. Pekes will tolerate kids but won\u2019t stand for a lot of roughhousing. The Pekingese, a compact toy companion of regal bearing and a distinctive rolling gait, is one of several breeds created for the ruling classes of ancient China. These are sophisticated dogs of undying loyalty and many subtle delights.","Shih-Tzu":"Shih Tzu (pronounced in the West \u201csheed-zoo\u201d or \u201csheet-su\u201d; the Chinese say \u201csher-zer\u201d), weighing between 9 to 16 pounds, and standing between 8 and 11 inches, are surprisingly solid for dogs their size. The coat, which comes in many colors, is worth the time you will put into it\u2014few dogs are as beautiful as a well-groomed Shih Tzu.Being cute is a way of life for this lively charmer. The Shih Tzu is known to be especially affectionate with children. As a small dog bred to spend most of their day inside royal palaces, they make a great pet if you live in an apartment or lack a big backyard. Some dogs live to dig holes and chase cats, but a Shih Tzu\u2019s idea of fun is sitting in your lap acting adorable as you try to watch TV. That face! Those big dark eyes looking up at you with that sweet expression! It\u2019s no surprise that Shih Tzu owners have been so delighted with this little \u201cLion Dog\u201d for a thousand years. Where Shih Tzu go, giggles and mischief follow.","papillon":"A tiny dog, measuring 8 to 11 inches at the shoulder, you can still spot a Papillon a block away thanks to the large, wing-shaped ears that give the breed its name (\u201cpapillon\u201d is French for \u201cbutterfly\u201d). Some Paps have erect ears; in others, known as the Phalene type, the ears are down. Paps are dainty and elegant, with a plumed tail, and a long, silky coat of several color combinations, the base color being white. More robust than they look, Paps are little dogs for all seasons and reasons. They thrive in warm or cool climates, in town or country, and are eager to join family fun. They are excellent agility dogs and are consistent winners at the sport\u2019s highest levels; less ambitious owners can train them to do all kinds of tricks. The quick, curious Papillon is a toy dog of singular beauty and upbeat athleticism. Despite his refined appearance, the Pap is truly a \u201cdoggy dog\u201d blessed with a hardy constitution. Papillon fanciers describe their breed as happy, alert, and friendly.","toy_terrier":"A surefire recipe for fun: Take the lovability of a lapdog. Combine with terrier tenacity. Pour the mixture into a beautifully balanced container. Wrap in a tight-fitting satin coat. Top with large, erect ears and dark eyes that sparkle with eager intelligence. This is the Toy Fox Terrier, a lithe but sturdy little comedian standing under a foot tall but packed with enough charisma for a whole kennel of ordinary dogs. The breed\u2019s admirers like to say, \u201cTFTs are truly a toy and a terrier.\u201d A diminutive satin-coated terrier with an amusing toy-dog personality, the Toy Fox Terrier is, as breed fanciers say, \u201ctruly a toy and a terrier.\u201d They began as barnyard ratters but are today beguiling companions with a big personality.","Rhodesian_ridgeback":"Beneath the Ridgeback\u2019s trademark ridge is a whole lot of hound: Ridgebacks are fast and powerful athletes who can weigh between 70 and 85 pounds, and oftentimes more. They come in only one color \u2013 wheaten \u2013 which spans every shade seen in a wheat field, from pale flaxen to the burnished red of a maturing crop. Ridgebacks also have two nose colors: black and the less commonly seen brown.The formidable Ridgeback can be strong willed, independent, and sometimes domineering. Ridgebacks must be guided with a firm but fair hand from puppyhood. They are faithful friends, protective of their loved ones and meltingly affectionate with those whom they trust. Still, a Ridgeback can be too much hound for the novice dog owner. The Rhodesian Ridgeback is an all-purpose \u201cRenaissance hound\u201d whose hallmark is the ridge, or stripe of backward-growing hair, on his back. Though the breed was made famous in its native Africa for its skill at tracking and baying \u2013 but never, ever killing \u2013 lions, today Ridgebacks are cherished family dogs whose owners must be prepared to deal with their independence and strong prey drive.","Afghan_hound":"The Afghan Hound is an ancient breed, his whole appearance one of dignity and aloofness \u2013 his eyes gazing into the distance as if in memory of ages past. An intelligent and independent mind, his whole appearance one of dignity and style. To his own he is devoted and loyal with a charming and lively personality. The Afghan Hound is an athlete capable of immense speed and requires a large fenced in yard and exercise daily.Since ancient times, Afghan Hounds have been famous for their elegant beauty. But the thick, silky, flowing coat that is the breed\u2019s crowning glory isn\u2019t just for show \u2014 it served as protection from the harsh climate in mountainous regions where Afghans originally earned their keep. Beneath the Afghan\u2019s glamorous exterior is a powerful, agile hound \u2014 standing as high as 27 inches at the shoulder \u2014 built for a long day\u2019s hunt. Their huge paw-pads acted as shock absorbers on their homeland\u2019s punishing terrain.The Afghan Hound is a special breed for special people. A breed expert writes, \u201cIt\u2019s not the breed for all would-be dog owners, but where the dog and owner combination is right, no animal can equal the Afghan Hound as a pet.\u201d The Afghan Hound is an aloof and dignified aristocrat of sublime beauty. Despite his regal appearance, he is known for his profound loyalty, sensitive nature, and absolute love for those he calls his own.","basset":"The Basset Hound stands no higher than 14 inches at the shoulder but, with his remarkably heavy bone, powerful little legs, and massive paws, he possesses big-dog strength and stamina. Bassets are famous for a large, domed head that features extremely long, velvety ears, mournful eyes, and a wrinkled brow, which give the breed the look of a sad clown. Built more for endurance than speed, the Basset moves in a deliberate but effortless manner. The breed\u2019s scenting ability is uncanny; it\u2019s said that among dogs only the Bloodhound\u2019s nose is more accurate. Mild and agreeable at home, the Basset is stubborn on the trail and barks in a loud, ringing voice. Although they may not be wildly demonstrative in their affections, they are steadfastly loyal. Among the most appealing of the AKC breeds, the endearing and instantly recognizable Basset Hound is a perennial favorite of dog lovers all over the world. This low-slung and low-key hound can be sometimes stubborn, but is always charming.","beagle":"There are two Beagle varieties: those standing under 13 inches at the shoulder, and those between 13 and 15 inches. Both varieties are sturdy, solid, and \u201cbig for their inches,\u201d as dog folks say. They come in such pleasing colors as lemon, red and white, and tricolor. The Beagle\u2019s fortune is in his adorable face, with its big brown or hazel eyes set off by long, houndy ears set low on a broad head.A breed described as \u201cmerry\u201d by its fanciers, Beagles are loving and lovable, happy, and companionable\u2014all qualities that make them excellent family dogs. No wonder that for years the Beagle has been the most popular hound dog among American pet owners. These are curious, clever, and energetic hounds who require plenty of playtime. Not only is the Beagle an excellent hunting dog and loyal companion, it is also happy-go-lucky, funny, and\u2014thanks to its pleading expression\u2014cute. They were bred to hunt in packs, so they enjoy company and are generally easygoing.","bloodhound":"Bloodhounds are large, substantial dogs standing 23 to 27 inches at the shoulder and weighing up to 110 pounds. Their most famous features are a long, wrinkled face with loose skin; huge, drooping ears; and warm, deep-set eyes that complete an expression of solemn dignity. Coat colors can be black and tan, liver and tan, or red. Powerful legs allow Bloodhounds to scent over miles of punishing terrain.As pack dogs, Bloodhounds enjoy company, including other dogs and kids. They are easygoing, but their nose can sometimes lead them into trouble. A strong leash and long walks in places where they can enjoy sniffing around are recommended. Bloodhounds are droolers, and obedience training these sensitive sleuths can be a challenge. The world famous \u201cSleuth Hound\u201d does one thing better than any creature on earth: find people who are lost or hiding. An off-duty Bloodhound is among the canine kingdom\u2019s most docile citizens, but he\u2019s relentless and stubborn on scent.","bluetick":"Blueticks are speedy and compact nocturnal hunters named for the mottled (or \u201cticked\u201d) black-and-blue pattern of the glossy coat. A large male can top out at 27 inches and 80 pounds; females are smaller. Blueticks are well-muscled but sleek and racy, never chunky or clumsy. The baying, bawling, and chopping bark of Blueticks might be cacophonous to some, but to coon hunters it\u2019s the music of the night.The droopy-eared charm of Blueticks is irresistible. They crave affection and are deeply devoted to those who provide it. Blueticks have tremendous prey drive. Neglected, underemployed coonhounds with no outlet for their hardwired impulses can develop problem behaviors, like serenading the neighbors with loud, mournful \u201cmusic.\u201d The sleekly beautiful Bluetick Coonhound is a sweet and affectionate charmer who might enjoy snoozing in the shade, but in pursuit of quarry he is relentless, bold, and single-minded. His off-the-charts prey drive must be channeled.","black-and-tan_coonhound":"Black and Tans have an amazingly sensitive nose, long, velvety ears, and a sweet disposition. The coal-black coat features rich tan accents, including the distinctive \u201cpumpkin seeds\u201d above keenly expressive eyes. These are big, strong hounds: A good-size male can stand 27 inches at the shoulder and cover ground with effortless, eager strides.B&Ts are sociable hounds. A lonely B&T will serenade the neighborhood with loud, mournful \u201cmusic.\u201d B&Ts can keep pace with the most active family, but they also can hog the sofa for hours on end. Hounds will be hounds: A passing squirrel can arouse B&T prey drive in no time flat, so a strong leash and sturdy fence are must-haves. B&Ts might be too much hound for the lifestyle of every owner. Large, athletic hunters who work nights, Black and Tan Coonhounds are friendly, easygoing hounds who love company. They are snoozy by the fireside but tenacious when on the trail of the wily raccoon. This hound is a real American original.","Walker_hound":"Few things can quicken a coon hunter\u2019s pulse like the sight of this swift, tricolored hound in full stride\u2014the long, muscular legs, the powerful and propulsive hindquarters, and the streamlined frame all working to cover maximum ground with minimum effort. Later, basking in the warmth of a campfire after an honest night\u2019s work, this sweet-faced hound will look up and stir your soul with his gentle, pleading expression. Mercy, what a pretty picture! No wonder Treeing Walkers are called the People\u2019s Choice. A smart, brave, and sensible hunter, the Treeing Walker Coonhound is a genuine American favorite, nicknamed \"The People\u2019s Choice.\" Don\u2019t let the name fool you\u2014Walkers are runners and are capable of covering a lot of ground in a hurry.","English_foxhound":"The English Foxhound is the epitome of what serious dog breeders strive for: beauty, balance, and utility. \u201cNext to an old Greek statue,\u201d a poet wrote, \u201cthere are few such combinations of grace and strength as in a fine Foxhound.\u201dThese pack-oriented, scent-driven hounds are gentle and sociable, but rarely seen as house pets. They can be so driven by a primal instinct for pursuit that not much else, including training, matters to them. Owning these noble creatures is best left to huntsmen who kennel packs of hounds or to those experienced in meeting the special challenges of life with swift, powerful hounds hardwired for the chase. The English Foxhound is a substantial galloping hound of great stamina. His long legs are straight as a gatepost, and just as sturdy. The back is perfectly level. And the chest is very deep, \u201cgirthing\u201d as much as 31 inches on a hound measuring 24 inches at the shoulder, ensuring plenty of lung power for a grueling day\u2019s hunt.","redbone":"Redbones are medium-to-large hound dogs whose muscles undulate beneath a sleek and stunning red coat. The overall impression is that a master sculptor carved them from blocks of the finest mahogany. The classically houndy head is flanked by ears long enough to reach the nose. Dreamy brown eyes give the face an expression described by the breed\u2019s devotees as \u201cpleading.\u201dBred to work on all kinds of punishing terrain, Redbones are fast and surefooted and move with a proud, determined gait. The streamlined Redbone Coonhound, an American original, is even-tempered, mellow, and kindly at home but a tiger on the trail. Vigorous activities like hunting and swimming between long periods of rest is the rhythm of coonhound life.","borzoi":"Borzoi are large, elegant sighthounds. A mature male stands at least 28 inches at the shoulder and weighs 75 to 105 pounds. Females will be smaller. Beneath the luxurious silky coat, Borzoi construction follows the ancient Greyhound template. Once known as the Russian Wolfhound, Borzoi were bred to be swift and tough enough to pursue and pin their ferocious lupine quarry.In their quiet, catlike way they can be stubborn, and training is best accomplished with patience, consistency, and good humor. Affectionate family dogs, Borzoi are nonetheless a bit too dignified to wholeheartedly enjoy a lot of roughhousing. The sight of a cat or squirrel on the run will quickly stir their pursuit instinct, and fenced-in running room is a must. Among the most impressively beautiful of all dogs, the aristocratic Borzoi is cherished for his calm, agreeable temperament. In full stride, he is a princely package of strength, grace, and glamour flying by at 35 to 40 miles per hour.","Irish_wolfhound":"The amiable Irish Wolfhound is an immense, muscular hound gracefully built along classic Greyhound lines, capable of great speed at the gallop. A male might stand nearly 3 feet at the shoulder and weigh up to 180 pounds. Females will run smaller but are still a whole lot of hound. The rough, hard coat comes in many colors, including white, gray, brindle, red, black, and fawn.IWs are too serene to be fierce guard dogs, but just the sight of them is enough to deter intruders. IWs are characteristically patient with kids, though animals their size should be supervised around small children. Owning an Irish Wolfhound is a unique, rewarding experience\u2014but acquiring a giant galloping hound is a commitment as big as the dog itself. The calm, dignified, and kindly Irish Wolfhound is the tallest of all AKC breeds. Once fearless big-game hunters capable of dispatching a wolf in single combat, Wolfhounds today are the most serene and agreeable of companions.","Italian_greyhound":"IGs are Greyhounds in miniature\u2014more slender, but a Greyhound\u2019s equal in grace and elegance. Standing ideally 13 to 15 inches at the shoulder, they present the sleek, curving lines common to all coursing hounds. Distinguishing features are the long, fine-boned legs.IGs combine the attentiveness of lapdogs with the complexity of ancient, aristocratic hounds. Bred for centuries to be doting companions and jesters, these high-stepping charmers refuse to be ignored. \u201cOn the whole,\u201d writes an IG expert, \u201cthe breed would much rather be in your lap or bed than on the floor.\u201d They are, though, true sighthounds and will bolt after quick-moving prey at the drop of a cat. A short-coat, low-fat breed, IGs require extra care in cold weather A true Greyhound in miniature, the elegant Italian Greyhound is an alert, playful, and highly affectionate toy companion.

Inexperienced owners might be overwhelmed by this strong, self-confident, go-go herding dog eager for work.Entlebuchers are fine dogs\u2014clever, zesty, happy\u2014but not for everyone.

A male can stand as high as 25 inches at the shoulder; females run smaller. Their muscles ripple beneath a short, tight-fitting coat. The dark brown eyes and wrinkled forehead give the face an alert, curious look. The coat can be fawn or brindle, with white markings. Boxers move like the athletes they are named for: smooth and graceful, with a powerful forward thrust.Boxers are upbeat and playful. Their patience and protective nature have earned them a reputation as a great dog with children. They take the jobs of watchdog and family guardian seriously and will meet threats fearlessly.

Bright and alert, sometimes silly, but always courageous, the Boxer has been among America\u2019s most popular dog breeds for a very long time.","bull_mastiff":"The Bullmastiff isn\u2019t quite as large as his close cousin the Mastiff. Still, standing as high as 27 inches at the shoulder and weighing between 100 and 130 pounds, this is still a whole lot of dog. After the first impression made by the Bullmastiff\u2019s size, it is the large, broad head that conveys the breed\u2019s essence: the dark eyes, high-set V-shaped ears, and broad, deep muzzle all combine to present the intelligence, alertness, and confidence that make the Bullmastiff a world-class protector and family companion. Coats come in fawn, red, or brindle.These are biddable and reliable creatures, but as with any large guarding dog, owners must begin training and socialization early, while the puppy is still small enough to control.

TMs can stand 26 inches at the shoulder and weigh well over 100 pounds. It\u2019s impossible to discuss this breed without leaning on words like \u201cpowerful,\u201d \u201cmuscular,\u201d \u201cmassive,\u201d and \u201csubstantial.\u201d And yet, TMs are quite light-footed and will meet a perceived threat with surprising agility. The broad head, with its high-set, V-shaped ears and expressive brown eyes, projects a noble, sagacious expression. Watchful, aloof, imposing, and intimidating: The ancient Tibetan Mastiff is the guardian dog supreme. These densely-coated giants are mellow and calm around the house, sweetly devoted to family, and aloof and territorial with strangers.","French_bulldog":"The French Bulldog resembles a Bulldog in miniature, except for the large, erect \u201cbat ears\u201d that are the breed\u2019s trademark feature. The head is large and square, with heavy wrinkles rolled above the extremely short nose. The body beneath the smooth, brilliant coat is compact and muscular.The bright, affectionate Frenchie is a charmer. Dogs of few words, Frenchies don\u2019t bark much\u2014but their alertness makes them excellent watchdogs. They happily adapt to life with singles, couples, or families, and do not require a lot of outdoor exercise. They get on well with other animals and enjoy making new friends of the human variety. It is no wonder that city folk from Paris to Peoria swear by this vastly amusing and companionable breed.

The coat comes in different colors and patterns, perhaps the best-known being the black-and-white patchwork pattern known as \u201charlequin.\u201dDespite their sweet nature, Danes are alert home guardians. Just the sight of these gentle giants is usually enough to make intruders think twice. But those foolish enough to mistake the breed\u2019s friendliness for softness will meet a powerful foe of true courage and spirit. Patient with kids, Danes are people pleasers who make friends easily. The easygoing Great Dane, the mighty \u201cApollo of Dogs,\u201d is a total joy to live with\u2014but owning a dog of such imposing size, weight, and strength is a commitment not to be entered into lightly. This breed is indeed great, but not a Dane.","Saint_Bernard":"Not ranked particularly high in AKC registrations, this genial giant is nonetheless among the world\u2019s most famous and beloved breeds. The Saint\u2019s written standard abounds with phrases like \u201cvery powerful,\u201d \u201cextraordinarily muscular,\u201d \u201cimposing,\u201d and \u201cmassive.\u201d A male stands a minimum 27.5 inches at the shoulder; females will be smaller and more delicately built.

Neither shy nor aggressive, Eskies are always alert and friendly, though a bit conservative when making new friends.","malamute":"The Alaskan Malamute stands 23 to 25 inches at the shoulder and weighs 75 to 85 pounds. Everything about Mals suggests their origin as an arctic sled dog: The heavy bone, deep chest, powerful shoulders, and dense, weatherproof coat all scream, \u201cI work hard for a living!\u201d But their almond-shaped brown eyes have an affectionate sparkle, suggesting Mals enjoy snuggling with their humans when the workday is done. Mals are pack animals. And in your family \u201cpack,\u201d the leader must be you. If a Mal doesn\u2019t respect you, he will wind up owning you instead of the other way around. Firm but loving training should begin in early puppyhood. That said, a well-behaved Mal is a joy to be with\u2014playful, gentle, friendly, and great with kids.

Quick and nimble-footed, Siberians are known for their powerful but seemingly effortless gait. Tipping the scales at no more than 60 pounds, they are noticeably smaller and lighter than their burly cousin, the Alaskan Malamute. In fact, breeders and fanciers prefer the moniker Siberians over huskies, as the latter suggests a bigger, brawnier dog than what is the standard for the breed.As born pack dogs, Siberians enjoy family life and get on well with other dogs; their innate friendliness render them indifferent watchdogs. This breed is also energetic and can\u2019t resist chasing small animals, so secure running room is a must. An attractive feature of the breed: Siberians are naturally clean, with little doggy odor. The Siberian Husky, a thickly coated, compact sled dog of medium size and great endurance, was developed to work in packs, pulling light loads at moderate speeds over vast frozen expanses. This northern breed is friendly, fastidious, and dignified.","affenpinscher":"The Affen\u2019s apish look has been described many ways. They\u2019ve been called \u201cmonkey dogs\u201d and \u201cape terriers.\u201d The French say diablotin moustachu (\u201cmustached little devil\u201d), and Star Wars fans argue whether they look more like Wookies or Ewoks.Standing less than a foot tall, these sturdy terrier-like dogs approach life with great confidence. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a breed you train,\u201d a professional dog handler tells us, \u201cHe\u2019s like a human. You befriend him.\u201d The dense, harsh coat is described as \u201cneat but shaggy\u201d and comes in several colors; the gait is light and confident. They can be willful and domineering, but mostly Affens are loyal, affectionate, and always entertaining. Affen people say they love being owned by their little monkey dogs. The Affenpinscher: loyal, curious, and famously amusing; this almost-human toy dog is fearless out of all proportion to his size. As with all great comedians, it\u2019s the Affenpinscher\u2019s apparent seriousness of purpose that makes his antics all the more amusing.","basenji":"Basenjis are small, graceful hounds standing 16 or 17 inches at the shoulder. They are recognizable by their glistening short coat, tightly curled tail, and wrinkled forehead and expressive almond-shaped eyes that convey a variety of subtle, humanlike emotions.Basenjis are a lovely sight at a standstill but more impressive yet at a fast trot, when they exhibit the long, smooth strides of a mini-racehorse. And yes, it\u2019s true, they don\u2019t bark, but they make their feelings known with an odd sound described as something between a chortle and a yodel. Basenjis are fastidious and will groom themselves like cats. This has been called a \u201ccult breed\u201d\u2014small in numbers, but those lucky enough to own one do so with singular devotion.
