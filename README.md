# Dog_Breed_Categorization

### Topic:
- Image classification for dog breeds.

### Purpose:
- Sometimes people are out and about when they see a cute dog that they know nothing about but would like to. My group and I are working on a project that can help people identify a dog's breed based off an image. Our goal is to create a web app that can help people identify what type of dog they run into, and maybe some basic information about the breed type. 

### Data Sources:
- Images of 120 different dog breeds with multiple images per breed type provided by:
    - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/stanford-dogs-dataset

- A csv file listing all the different dog breeds and their attributes
    - akc-data-latest.csv 
    - Downloaded from the following GitHub profile:
        - https://github.com/tmfilho/akcdata
        - Licence for the data: https://github.com/tmfilho/akcdata/blob/master/LICENSE 

### Communication:
