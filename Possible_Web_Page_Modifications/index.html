        <p>
          Has anyone ever asked you what kind of dog you have, but you really don't know what to tell them?
          Or have you ever been anywhere and ran across a dog that you didn't know what it was but wanted to?
          Then our dog breed identifier might be right for you!

        <h3>Dog Breed Identification:</h3>
        <p>
          With the advances in machine learning, an image can be processed 
          and identified as being part of a specific group. This particular neural 
          will take an image of a dog and attempt to classify it with the correct breed.<br>
          This model has been trained to 80% accuracy.<br> 
          Have Fun!
